After testing to make sure canned data was being pulled and displayed correctly, I implemented the functions that switched it to real, updating data.

I was also in charge of the logic and implementation behind how each user\u2019s vote was counted for the running score and the final score. Based off this, I updated the user stats displayed on the user\u2019s page, including determining if they met \u201cInfluencer\u201d status or not. I single-handedly wrote the functions that ran after each post\u2019s time limit of 24 hours expired. These functions updated the score of each person who voted and took them off this list of posts that could be voted on. I also worked further filtering the posts each user could vote on by only allowing them to vote once per post and only on others' posts.
