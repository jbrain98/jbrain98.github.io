After testing to make sure canned data was being pulled and displayed correctly,\r\n                    I implemented the functions that switched it to real, updating data. This included coding it so\r\n                    that each time a user opens the app it would either\r\n                    load the information from the user entry associated with the phone’s id or create a new user entry.\r\n                    I was also in charge of the logic and implementation behind how each user’s vote was counted\r\n                    for the running score and the final score. Based off this, I updated the user stats displayed on the\r\n                    user’s page, including determining if they met “Influencer” status or not. I single-handedly wrote\r\n                    the functions that ran after each post’s time limit of 24 hours expired. These functions updated\r\n                    the score of each person who voted and took them off this list of posts that could be voted on.\r\n                    I also worked further filtering the posts each user could vote on by only allowing them to vote\r\n                    once per post and only on others' posts. For the front end, I created the user stats bar by\r\n                    myself as well as doing other minor UI changes included in the different sprints.\r\n\r\n                    </p>\r\n                <br />\r\n            </Grid>\r\n\r\n        </Grid>\r\n\r\n    )\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst Heading = (text) => (\r\n    <p>\r\n        <b>{text}</b>\r\n        <br />\r\n    </p>\r\n\r\n)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default FABPage","import React from 'react';\r\nimport { Grid, Divider, Button, Card, CardContent, CardMedia, CardActions } from '@material-ui/core';\r\nimport \"../ProjectPage.css\"\r\nimport SplashPage from \"../projectPics/Shareable/SplashPage.PNG\"\r\nimport Enter from \"../projectPics/Shareable/Enter.PNG\"\r\nimport Filters from \"../projectPics/Shareable/Filters.PNG\"\r\nimport Groups from \"../projectPics/Shareable/Groups.PNG\"\r\nimport Messages from \"../projectPics/Shareable/Messages.PNG\"\r\nimport Michael from \"../projectPics/Shareable/Michael.PNG\"\r\nimport Olivia from \"../projectPics/Shareable/Olivia.PNG\"\r\nimport Profile from \"../projectPics/Shareable/Profile.PNG\"\r\nimport Sizes from \"../projectPics/Shareable/Sizes.PNG\"\r\nimport Front from \"../projectPics/Shareable/Front.PNG\"\r\nimport Paper from \"../projectPics/Shareable/Paper.PNG\"\r\n\r\nconst ShareablePage = () => {\r\n    return (\r\n        <Grid\r\n            container\r\n            direction=\"row\"\r\n            justify=\"center\"\r\n            spacing={5}>\r\n            <Grid item xs={10} >\r\n                <p className=\"heading\">Shareable</p>\r\n                <hr className=\"divider\" />\r\n            </Grid>\r\n            <Grid item xs={10} sm={5} className=\"left\">\r\n                <img src={SplashPage} className=\"prjpic\" />                \r\n                <Technologies />\r\n                <Teamwork />\r\n                <br />\r\n                <img src={Filters} className=\"prjpicb\" />  \r\n                <Group />\r\n                <br />\r\n                <img src={Olivia} className=\"prjpicc\" /> \r\n                <br />\r\n                <img src={Michael} className=\"prjpicc\" /> \r\n                <br />\r\n                <img src={Paper} className=\"prjpicb\" /> \r\n                <FinalProduct />\r\n                <br />\r\n                <img src={Messages} className=\"prjpicb\" /> \r\n                <MyImpact />\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                \r\n\r\n            </Grid>\r\n            <Grid item xs={10} sm={5} className=\"right\">\r\n                <Description />\r\n                <br />\r\n                <img src={Front} className=\"prjpicb\" />  \r\n                <UserStories />\r\n                <br />\r\n                <img src={Groups} className=\"prjpicb\" /> \r\n                <Personas />\r\n                <UserTesting />\r\n                <br />\r\n                <img src={Enter} className=\"prjpicb\" /> \r\n                <Takeaways />\r\n                \r\n                \r\n                \r\n            </Grid>\r\n\r\n        </Grid>\r\n\r\n    )\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst Teamwork = () => (\r\n    <p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <b>Teamwork</b>\r\n        <br />\r\n    I collaborated on a team of six as we worked on developing our own app idea using an iterative design process.\r\n    </p>\r\n)\r\n\r\nconst Technologies = () => (\r\n    <p> <br /><b>Technologies</b>\r\n        <br />\r\n    Figma</p>\r\n\r\n)\r\n\r\nconst Description = () => (\r\n    <p>\r\n        <b>Group Clothes Sharing</b>\r\n        <p>How might we allow one to borrow and lend clothes safely so they do not have to spend a lot of money on clothes they only wear once?\r\n                        <br />\r\n            <br />\r\n                        In class we came up with several design ideas for an iPad app. However, this was the \"how might we\" question we were most\r\n                        drawn to. We all had many experiences with lending and borrow some particular article of clothing and knew\r\n                        how cumbersome it could be. One of the worst experiences we knew of was\r\n                        a case where someone offered her to lend her dresses through her sororities unregulated\r\n                        formal \"dress bank\" - she never got them back. Cases such as this drew us to this particular design space.\r\n        </p>\r\n    </p>\r\n)\r\n\r\nconst UserStories = () => (\r\n    <p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <b>Importance of User Stories</b> <br />\r\n        After we determined our design space, we worked together to go through potential user stories to determine user needs.\r\n        Through this, we determined that there were four major stories involved in the app: creating an account, finding items to borrow\r\n        and borrowing them, uploading items to loan out, and loaning out items. We then went through each user story to see what features\r\n        would be necessary as well as what features could be added to making using the app a delightful experience. Some of these features\r\n        include: filtering based off common requirements for events (such as color or clothing article), \r\n        a messaging service within the app for easy communication with lenders and borrowers, and saved user clothing sizes for ease of use.\r\n    </p>\r\n)\r\n\r\nconst Group = () => (\r\n    <p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <b>Group Lending</b> <br />\r\n        However, the most important feature we decided on during our ideation design phase was groups. We discovered that many people were\r\n        uncomfortable with the prospect of lending clothes to people they did not know. For this reason, we decided to have\r\n        users make and join \"Groups\" in order to borrow and lend clothes. These could be as informal as a friend group or as formal as\r\n        an interview clothing bank for a business fraternity. Because we decided to require borrowing through these groups, people felt\r\n        more secure in loaning out their clothes.    \r\n    </p>\r\n)\r\n\r\nconst Personas = () => (\r\n    <p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <b>Personas</b> <br />\r\n        We decided to focus largely on university students when designing the app, but the app could be used by anyone. Focusing on two\r\n        main personas allowed us to realize the importance of features such as sorting by color (as Michael needs a red shirt for\r\n        his Refresh dance group performance outfit)    \r\n    </p>\r\n)\r\n\r\nconst UserTesting = () => (\r\n    <p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <b>Paper User Testing</b> <br />\r\n        After determining some basic features we drew a paper protype of our app. Using this, we then tested the app by having\r\n        five different people that fit within our target audience of college students but might different needs. Based off this feedback\r\n        we made the app more gender inclusive (including changing the name from \"The Dress Bank\" to the more gender-neutral \"Shareable\"\r\n        and adding a specific male sizing page). We also made some edits to the flow of the app, changed some filters, \r\n        and tried to standarize the sizing. Balancing the amount of work required from the users with adding features that would be nice to have\r\n        was something we paid particular attention to. For example, it would be nice to have a lot of details about an item before you borrow it,\r\n        but that would require the loaner to fill out a lot of information and would be frustrating. \r\n    </p>\r\n)\r\n\r\nconst FinalProduct = () => (\r\n    <p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <b>Figma</b> <br />\r\n        Our final product was a Figma prototype.

Interestingly enough, it felt like I was in more of a client role\r\n        for this project as I was working on determining the design and features of the app instead of coding someone else's ideas. I think it\r\n        is very important to be able to do both, and in this project I had the ability to as a team tackle whatever design space I found interesting.\r\n        As all design projects do, it also reiterated the importance of the design process and how important user testing is. Before this\r\n        I had never used Figma, so I also learned a new technology I can utilize in the future.\r\n    </p>\r\n)\r\n\r\nconst MyImpact = () => (\r\n    <p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <b>My Impact</b> <br />\r\n        I was very vocal when we as a group were discussing user stories and potential features. In particular, I was one of the strong supporters\r\n        of the idea of group-centered loaning. Throughout the process I was involved in all tasks, including the paper prototyping\r\n        and user testing.
